      <h1>Cloud deployment is better. But that doesn’t make it easy.</h1>
      <p>
        Any federal agency deploying an app has to follow regulations, manage an
        ATO process, and design a robust service infrastructure. Cloud hosting
        saves one hassle — managing data centers — and creates another: operating
        cloud infrastructure and keeping it compliant. It requires a different set
        of skills that isn’t widely available in government yet.

      <h1>We’re familiar with the challenges of government cloud ops.</h1>
      <p>
        18F is a team within the General Services Administration that builds
        applications for the federal government, rapidly and iteratively. So as
        we scaled up the number of teams deploying applications, we couldn’t let
        cloud operations talent become the kind of bottleneck that slows down
        development for many federal teams. Instead of working on infrastructure
        support for every individual product, our cloud ops staff focused on how
        they could give all our development teams a better way to work.

      <h1>This is why we built cloud.gov.</h1>
      <p>
        cloud.gov is 18F’s cloud-hosting product line for federal teams. It addresses
        baseline security and scalability concerns addressed consistently, right up
        front, without requiring a huge number of cloud operations experts. Instead,
        digital service teams can use these tools to focus on delivering quality
        products.

        <h3>Platform-as-a-service</h3>
        <p>
          We remove the complexity of the cloud infrastructure and give you a
          usable interface that you can use to deploy secure apps quickly. This
          is platform-as-a-service, or PaaS.

      </div>
      <div class="three_up-part">
        <h3>Security documentation support</h3>
        <p>
          As a byproduct of building the platform, we have open source,
          software-friendly documentation of cloud.gov’s NIST controls, ready to
          incorporate into your own FISMA and ATO documentation, however you
          need it.

      <div class="three_up-part">
        <h3>More to come</h3>
        <p>
          Where cloud.gov goes from here will be based on how teams use it
          today. Already, we are exploring additional products: domain
          microservices, access to third-party tools, and technologies that may
          be needed for “government-as-a-service”.

      <h1>cloud.gov makes deployments easier, faster, and stronger.</h1>
      <p>
        We don’t think the challenges we faced are unique. All agencies have a
        mandate to deploy their services in the cloud, and all cloud deployments
        require operations support, security, and compliance. We give you that.

        <h3>Usability</h3>
        <p>
          We use an open source API and tools for teams to take care of
          environments, services, applications, access points, and billing
          structures. Your use our straightforward UI to deliver a great app.

        <h3>Scalability</h3>
        <p>
          The cloud.gov support team provides spot support for teams when they
          encounter issues. We use what we learn from this work to improve
          cloud.gov, addressing these issues for every team at once.

      <div class="four_up-part">
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
          We deploy on a hardened operating system. We centrally scan and audit
          the platform and every application on it. And the open source,
          publicly documented deployment creates an economy of scale that
          benefits every app, no matter who owns it.

        <h3>Conformity with federal rules</h3>
        <p>
          Every NIST control for our platform, infrastructure, and human layers
          is documented and ready to use in many different contexts, updated
          automatically as we update the platform. Use our work to shave dozens
          of hours off the usual app-by-app, copy-and-paste compliance process.

      <h1>It’s a solution that keeps getting better.</h1>
      <p>
        We built cloud.gov on the open source, public Cloud Foundry project. We
        completed the first prototype in about three months, and we started
        launching production apps about a month after that. We continue to
        fine-tune it based on the needs of the apps teams have built.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because it’s open source, we can continue to take advantage of
        improvements to the operability and security of Cloud Foundry. It helps
        us scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because it’s an agile project, cloud.gov is always under development. As
        we observe its use, we will continue to add new capabilities. Therefore,
        we do not say it is “complete” and we probably never will.

        <p>
          “With the help of cloud.gov, College Scorecard was able to focus on making important data available to the public. The streamlined ATO process was incredibly helpful in helping the project go live on schedule. We needed specific services that were not yet available in the platform, and the cloud.gov team responded quickly and supported our needs, letting us focus on the data and the software.” — <strong>Sarah Allen, 18F developer on the <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/">College Scorecard</a> team</strong>

      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “I managed the staging environment for the eRegs instance at CFPB and spent at least a fifth of my time managing the instance. On ATF's eRegs instance, which runs on cloud.gov, that time was cut down to less than a day of configuration. I will gladly remove "server management" from my resume now.” — <strong>CM Lubinksi, 18F developer on the <a href="https://atf-eregs.18f.gov/">ATF eRegulations</a> team</strong>

      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “The platform actually allows us to follow the fundamental software tenet of not repeating ourselves versus our previous framework. Every subsequent deploy of a stack allows us to add to our toolset for future re-use.” — <strong>Kaitlin Devine, 18F Director of Engineering</strong>
