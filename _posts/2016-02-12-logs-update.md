## New logging service

The cloud.gov recently launched the shared logging service. You can access it today at https://logs.cloud.gov.

Given the common need for extended and compliant logging, we decided to build it as a service. Now, every cloud.gov  application will have their logs stored automatically, zero setup required.

To use it, visit https://logs.cloud.gov and use your cloud.gov credentials to log in. You can access both application logs and platform events, all of which will be persisted for 180 days.

Now that we have a shared service for logs, the ELK service will be deprecated. If you are still using it, we recommend you delete the instance whenever is convenient.

If you have feedback about this service, please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:cloud-gov-support@gsa.gov).
