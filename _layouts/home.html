      <h1>Cloud deployment is better. But that doesn’t make it easy.</h1>
      <p>
        Any federal agency deploying an app has to follow regulations, manage an
        ATO process, and design a robust service infrastructure. Cloud hosting
        saves one hassle — managing data centers — and creates another: operating
        cloud infrastructure and keeping it compliant. It requires a different set
        of skills that isn’t widely available in government yet.

      <h1>We’re familiar with the challenges of government cloud ops.</h1>
      <p>
        18F is a team within the General Services Administration that builds
        applications for the federal government, rapidly and iteratively. So as
        we scaled up the number of teams deploying applications, we couldn’t let
        cloud operations talent become the kind of bottleneck that slows down
        development for many federal teams. Instead of working on infrastructure
        support for every individual product, our cloud ops staff focused on how
        they could give all our development teams a better way to work.

      <h1>This is why we built cloud.gov.</h1>
      <p>
        cloud.gov is 18F’s cloud-hosting product line for federal teams. It addresses
        baseline security and scalability concerns addressed consistently, right up
        front, without requiring a huge number of cloud operations experts. Instead,
        digital service teams can use these tools to focus on delivering quality
        products.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “With the help of cloud.gov, College Scorecard was able to focus on making important data available to the public. The streamlined ATO process was incredibly helpful in helping the project go live on schedule. We needed specific services that were not yet available in the platform, and the cloud.gov team responded quickly and supported our needs, letting us focus on the data and the software.” — <strong>Sarah Allen, 18F developer on the <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/">College Scorecard</a> team</strong> 
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “I managed the staging environment for the eRegs instance at CFPB and spent at least a fifth of my time managing the instance. On ATF's eRegs instance, which runs on cloud.gov, that time was cut down to less than a day of configuration. I will gladly remove "server management" from my resume now.” — <strong>CM Lubinksi, 18F developer on the <a href="https://atf-eregs.18f.gov/">ATF eRegulations</a> team</strong>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “The platform actually allows us to follow the fundamental software tenet of not repeating ourselves versus our previous framework. Every subsequent deploy of a stack allows us to add to our toolset for future re-use.” — <strong>Kaitlin Devine, 18F Director of Engineering</strong>
