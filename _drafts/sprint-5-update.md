title: New - Even more console updates and published updates
---
Now you can view log and event data for your apps and adjust permissions for your org and spaces via the web. We're also publishing these updates via [cloud.18f.gov](http://cloud.18f.gov/updates/).

# View log and event data for your apps in the console
When you take a look at the details for an application via the [cloud.gov console](http://console.18f.gov), you'll now be able to see any recent logs generated by your application, as well as a list of recent deployment events from cloud.gov itself.

# Adjust permissions for your orgs and spaces in the console
It's now possible to inspect and adjust the permissions for the individual orgs and spaces you control. 

# Updates now published via the cloud.18f.gov
We've also started consolidating announcement about updates to cloud.gov, like this one, on cloud.18f.gov! [Check it out.](http://cloud.18f.gov/updates/)

# Other stuff
We're now publishing our [roadmap](https://18f.storiesonboard.com/m/gov-dev) in [story-map form](http://jpattonassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/story_mapping.pdf) in case anyone wants to get a peek at what we're focused on now and what we're juggling for the future. Our focus right now is: **Buttoning up loose ends that prevent us from offering cloud.gov to other agencies.**

Our [intra-sprint kanban board](https://trello.com/b/ChGzyepo/gov-dev) is also visible, as is the [calendar of cloud.gov team rituals](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_0samf7guodi7o2jhdp0ec99aks%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles) for anyone who would like to attend.

That's all for now... If you've got any questions about the information above, please [let us know](mailto:bret.mogilefsky@gsa.gov)!
